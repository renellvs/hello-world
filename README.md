# hello-world
I am doing this for my class as an in-class activity.

My name is Renell Sherman. I am an NWTC student taking software developements. I am currently addicted to Monster Hunter World and League of Legends. My two favorite games of all time are both Square Enix RPGs. You can usually find me weekend mornings working at the prohibition spirits and cigar lounge.


Good job!
